# DSC180A Quarter 1 Project: Predicting Deliquency of Credit Applicants
This project explores relevant attributes in predicting future delinquencies utlizing models on datasets given, one containing purely training data and another being the holdout set. The models used in this project are XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier.

## Accessing Training and Holdout data

The training data can be accessed through this google link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_C3Hx2s0YJ0rTdOPNVvufA1bRH5eRrPO/view?usp=sharing

The holdout set can be accessed through this google link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_C3Hx2s0YJ0rTdOPNVvufA1bRH5eRrPO/view?usp=sharing

(1) Download the data from the links, copy the filepath in which they are stored.

(2) In their respective config files, replace outdir with the filepath of each file.

## Viewing the Results
To view the ROC scores of the models, run  ``` python run.py results ```
